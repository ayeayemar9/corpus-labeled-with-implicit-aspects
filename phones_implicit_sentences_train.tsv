p1263	" i know it was a cheap buy , but i thought at the least it would do what it is suppose to and fit on an actual phone ."	battery
p1264	" it 's not that bad , but i thought it would be better ."	battery
p1265	 this case turned out better than i thought it would be .	battery
p1266	 i thought i would have been a little better then what i thought .	battery
p1267	 first i thought this phone would be too big but it turned out to be great size and has excellent features .	battery
p1268	 it was not as sparkling as i thought it was going to be either .	battery
p1269	 bought as i thought it would be nice to have a pointer for my ipad .	battery
p1270	" i made a good choice wheni thought of buying this , its very safe , & not to bulky !"	battery
p1271	 i will say the high output port is slightly better 800ma vs 700ma .	battery
p1272	 it does n't have enough output to charge my phone .	battery
p1273	 i did a little research and this is the cheapest 2 prong high output charger i could find .	battery
p1274	 1 amp and which is 1 amp is not clear like the plastic faced one is with a diagram to tell which is output 1 and which is output 2 .	battery
p1275	 generic ( ma output and reliability at the top of the list !	battery
p1276	" if the phone is doing anything ( even just idling on ) , the output of this charger is not enough to keep my s2 from draining ."	battery
p1277	" when plugged in , one hears a high pitch noise on the speaker output ."	battery
p1278	" i got what a paid for , after a few months the charger started turning off and on a failing to maintain continuous power ."	battery
p1279	" that 's a++ in my book , especially if you use the gps a lot which drains the iphone pretty fast ."	battery
p1280	" if your the type that runs off and forgets to charge up the cell phone , this can be a life saver ."	battery
p1281	 charger works with my phone and charges without over heating or draining like some others have said .	battery
p1282	 they charge extremely slow and i suspect some damage to my phone because it actually ended up overheating it .	battery
p1283	" it does not charge my phone and in fact , it drains the phone ."	battery
p1284	" it charges and charges and then when the phone dies , it dies as well maybe 25 mins later !"	battery
p1285	" it charges itself ( wasting a lot of energy and precious wall time ) , ultimately charging my phone less ."	battery
p1286	" also , it is a pain to remove from the phone ."	battery
p1287	 it 's also a little tricky to remove from your device .	battery
p1288	 hard to remove which is probably a good thing .	battery
p1289	" a little more challenging to remove , but you do n't want a case that is falling off ."	battery
p1290	" however , this is not a good buy if you have to remove the phone from its case often to charge it ."	battery
p1291	 but i 'd like it better if it were easier to remove .	battery
p1292	" i am just worried that if i need to remove it for some reason , it will break when i try to remove it ."	battery
p1293	" however , once you snap it on , it is almost impossible to remove withouth breaking the plastic ."	battery
p1294	 it 's very difficult to remove the case once you put it on .	battery
p1295	 the only problem is trying to remove the back cover .	battery
p1296	 i do however have to say that it is difficult to pull the phone off of the clip with ease .	battery
p1297	" i ordered the hard cover for my blackberry curve thinking it would jazz it up a bit , but i did n't realize how difficult the case would be to remove ."	battery
p1298	 it was extremely difficult to remove the case to put the phone in the charger .	battery
p1299	 very difficult to remove the cover once you have it on the phone	battery
p1300	 the case comes in 2 parts that snap together - rather difficult to take off .	battery
p1301	 they do not plug in good in the device in the vehicles so they do not charge either of our phones .	battery
p1302	 that 's with no wifi/bluetooth on for either charge .	battery
p1303	" this charger does that , but none of the batteries i charge on it seem to last as long as when i charge them on the motorola charger ."	battery
p1304	 the case would not charge every time when connected to usb charger .	battery
p1305	" i wake at 5am , and the phone will last me until with the case charged until 10pm ..."	battery
p1306	" do n't waste your money , it will not charge both case and phone you have to cycle between the two and charge time is slow and it only bought an aditional 30 % battery life when you do manage to get both the phone and case charged ."	battery
p1307	 if you want to charge both phone and case battery at the same time turn on the case look at battery icon on your phone to ensure case is charging your phone .	battery
p1308	" if you do n't make sure the case is on when you charge it , it will only charge the case ."	battery
p1309	 it only adds about 20 % more battery when both the case and the phone are on and the case battery does n't last long .	battery
p1310	" when i 've attempted to charge the phone in the case overnight ( with the case turned on ) , the phone is still not fully charged some 7 hours later ."	battery
p1311	" the powerbear case became an extension to my phone that i never have to take off because when i charge it at night , it charges both my phone and the case , and i have battery life for more than two days ."	battery
p1312	" ) does n't charge the phone and the case when connected , only case ."	battery
p1313	" i can not charge my phone with this case on , have to remove the case and then charge my phone , not recommended at all ."	battery
p1314	" brought it home just in case the problem was in friends apartment , and it does n't charge my phone despite the & # 34 ; charge & # 34 ; function showing ."	battery
p1315	" now , the case will not charge my phone and i can no longer charge my phone while it is in the case ."	battery
p1316	" so , i took it off and tried to charge the case separately from the phone ."	battery
p1317	 i do n't know why i was charged this much money for a phone case !	battery
p1318	 this case allows my phone to be charged at all times during the day .	battery
p1319	 the charge function is not as good as my previous case .	battery
p1320	 the case has to be activated in order to charge the phone even with external charger .	battery
p1321	 ido n't know how but it 'll only charge if iput it in this case ...	battery
p1322	 phone charges when you put the case to charge so they charge at the same time .	battery
p1323	" he has a charge case for his last phone , and it covered the whole thing ."	battery
p1324	 i have to remove the case every time i want to charge my phone because the holes do not line up .	battery
p1325	" also , you ca n't charge your phone when the case is on ."	battery
p1326	" the case had arrived defective , it was broken there was no possible way to be used ."	battery
p1327	 overall it looks like a good product but mine came in defective and broken though .	battery
p1328	 the item came today but the case is defective .	battery
p1329	" this is going to change your life , but it works ."	battery
p1330	 i 'm glad that it lasts from start to end .	battery
p1331	" overall i would not buy this particular charger from any seller , its sucks the batter life out of your phone and gets super hot ."	battery
p1332	 but it only gives 50 or max 60 % battery..	battery
p1333	" unlike most of the rechargeable battery cases , powerbear lasts up to 2 whole days ."	battery
p1334	 it 's userful when your phone is out of battery .	battery
p1335	" also , its takes the jaws of life to pry off the covering !"	battery
p1336	" really , when pondering life and all of its wonder , is n't that all you need ?"	battery
p1337	 i had to buy a new battery after using .	battery
p1338	 when turned on it quickly recharges the battery .	battery
p1339	 connects from far away and battery lasts long .	battery
p1340	 battery lasts all day .	battery
p1341	" arguable one of the best cases for the iphone 4 , the battery lasts me literally for days and i am very impressed ."	battery
p1342	 started at 4amwas at 30 % by 3pm ( devices battery ) had to use gps for 2 hours driving10pm made it to destination at 10 % battery power after depleting both phone and cover 's battery .	battery
p1343	 with the extended battery i am able to enjoy all of the phones features without losing power .	battery
p1344	" it 's a life saver , and there is n't too much on the market at the time for this phone so i am happy with it ."	battery
p1345	 ok as it goes only able to use the front as i use the extended life battery and back will not fit on	battery
p1346	 the battery pack doubles my original charge and lets me go the full day without charging my phone .	battery
p1347	" great case , sturdy , doubles battery , wont have to worry any more ."	battery
p1348	" i like this particular design because it 's classy , complementing the evo lte ."	battery
p1349	 does n't seem to increase the slimness of the evo 4g lte overly much .	battery
p1350	 your phone loses % while it says it 's being charged .	battery
p1351	 i think the plug gets loose and loses connection too easily .	battery
p1352	 product came exactly as described and would recommend getting this if you like yourself a galaxy s3 and i would give this product a 5 star	battery
p1353	 this product was exactly what i thought i was ordering .	battery
p1354	" if this sounds like something you want , it 's exactly what you 'll get ."	battery
p1355	 i got exactly what i thought i was getting .	battery
p1356	 this is not working for my blackberry phone 9900 not sure why ?	battery
p1357	" my ipod touch ( twice ) , my blackberry , and even my golf gps unit ."	battery
p1358	 this adapter is exactly as described and works perfectly with my blackberry pearl .	battery
p1359	" this charger is what i wanted and it works great in recharging my blackberry , either at home or at a convention ."	battery
p1360	" this oem charger is from blackberry , and works as advertised ."	battery
p1361	 my daughter does not own a blackberry phone but is always using my charger .	battery
p1362	 does this charger work for the blackberry flip ?	battery
p1363	 but anyway more to the point someone please enlighten me and tell me if this charger works for the blackberry flip	battery
p1364	" i wish it has a retractable cord like some other chargers i 've used , but other than that , i love it ."	battery
p1365	 i bought this one because it was a fixed wire into the plug and longer .	battery
p1366	 on products such as these i would suggest placing measurements on the length of the chord so that consumers have an idea of what they are getting .	battery
p1367	 this charger seems to be the same as the original but a little longer nothing wrong with more room from the wallfor using while charging	battery
p1368	 the coiled wire is much shorter than any other charger i have ever used .	battery
p1369	" good product , i just wish it have a button to retract the string instead of pulling ."	battery
p1370	 just don '' t push retract button without holding other end !	battery
p1371	 it does not come with instructions and it took me about a day to figure out it had a button to retract it .	battery
p1372	" i have n't had it very long and this past week while on vacation , it failed to work any longer ."	battery
p1373	" in less than 7 months , it no longer works ."	battery
p1374	" best-n-price says `` sorry , its been longer than 7 days , your problem now '' ."	battery
p1375	 perhaps this one will actually work longer than 90 days .	battery
p1376	" so , do n't believe the thing is really longer than 2 feet , if that ."	battery
p1377	 i suspect it is the one that took a week longer than the other .	battery
p1378	 the cherry on the cake is because it is longer than the factory original l received with the phone .	battery
p1379	 it is longer than what is given with the phone .	battery
p1380	 i just wish it ( they ) were just longer ! ! ! ! !	battery
p1381	 it wo n't stay on the phone and is of no use any longer .	battery
p1382	" when you hold the phone tightly with way , the touch screen no longer works ."	battery
p1383	 the curly cable is short and stiff - very inconvenient to use .	battery
p1384	" the moment i started using it , it had a short in it ."	battery
p1385	" the charger does its job , but it 's short !"	battery
p1386	 this case clip for your phone is pretty but kinda irritating it catches on my hair and pulls it a lot	battery
p1387	" however , one could never use it that way because the thing pulls back into the coiled position that is not more than maybe two feet ."	battery
p1388	" 5 ' long , too short to reach the plug at my computer desk , but long enough to be usable on my night stand ."	battery
p1389	" one was much shorter than the other , and this shorter cable was not what i was expecting ."	battery
p1390	 i have tested this against the griffin dual output unit .	battery
p1391	 it has dual ports for both charging my cell phone and my gps .	battery
p1392	" it 's a great dual charger that will allow me to slow charge a device , quick charge one with the 2 ."	battery
p1393	 this dual port usb car charge does all it is suposed to do and looks good doing it !	battery
p1394	" my tab does not recognize the high power port and will either charge while off or use power while on , it will not charge while powered on ."	battery
p1395	 just got the dual usb car charger day before yesterday and i love the quality of the product .	battery
p1396	" i was happy about the prospect of this dual port charger , however i have to big issues with it ."	battery
p1397	 i have already migrated to another type vehicular charger which has dual usb receptacles and is rated at 2 .	battery
p1398	" the charger has a mini-usb plug , but the v188 phone needs a round concentric plug ."	battery
p1399	 if you need a charger and are tired of everyone `` borrowing '' yours to plug into the usb in the car or thier computer this is it !	battery
p1400	 from day one it would not work on one of my power source but i thought that it was my car until i tried using it in my wife 's car .	battery
p1401	 i am on the road all day everyday and the car only has one charging port so i 'm glad to have this .	battery
p1402	 this product is great since my car only has one charging port .	battery
p1403	 thought it was my car charger port but when i tried it in another car it still would not work .	battery
p1404	 i have seen youtube videos of the device connecting to a usb hub and running a myriad of different devices .	battery
p1405	" when i read the description , i improperly assumed that the dual ports shown as for apple and others , but that both where the & # 34 ; high output & # 34 ; ports ."	battery
p1406	 i love that it has two ports for my phone and ipod .	battery
p1407	 one of the hub ports fell out the second week of use .	battery
p1408	 of the two ports one is in the middle and one is on top of that .	battery
p1409	" i still despise the little charging pin ports nokia uses , come on mini usb standard !"	battery
p1410	" first off , the charger works just as it should and all the ports stay connected just fine ."	battery
p1411	 i have historically had to replace chargers because the ports got slack & they give after a while .	battery
p1412	" fits just right over the phone , does not interfere with buttons or ports ."	battery
p1413	 the cable that fill both ports are for both data and charging .	battery
p1414	 fits well on my phone and has all the right cutouts for all the ports and camera features .	battery
p1415	 can plug in two things at one time ... .	battery
p1416	 i 've had this charger for several months now .	battery
p1417	 i 've had this phone for only 3 months ...	battery
p1418	 i have had this phone cover for several months now .	battery
p1419	 i used this charger for a couple of months now .	battery
p1420	" i 've had this charger for less than six months , and it already stopped charging my phone ."	battery
p1421	 this charger died on me after having it for a few months .	battery
p1422	 i 've been using it for several months now .	battery
p1423	" i typically just use the standard travel charger in my car , but this is also nice to have ."	battery
p1424	 but i have been with out a car phone charger for so long i love it just the way it is .	battery
p1425	" when you 're uplugging a cable it 's easy to pull off that cover -- and then the whole thing comes apart , and you 'll see what a piece of junk it is ."	battery
p1426	 4vthis time i used a 3 ' cable rather than the original 6 ' test cableusing the 3 ' cable ...	battery
p1427	 now you can either buy a special cable ( the sell it here ) or you can open up this little bugger and solder them .	battery
p1428	 i had a charger cable already that came in a bundle package .	battery
p1429	" it 's so bad there 's a big gap where the cable meets the main body of the charger , so big the cable fastener pries loose ."	battery
p1430	 nothing so special about it just an ordinary charging cable with samsung engraving .	battery
p1431	 it has a very thick cable but does not charge phone .	battery
p1432	 cable is shortyou will damage the cellphone connector if you try to talk while charging due to the shortness of the cable	battery
p1433	 i then tried to use the cable with another charger i knew that worked and it still did n't work .	battery
p1434	" this charger was as expected , and much cheaper than just the cable that i needed ."	battery
p1435	" although i do not use the charger , the cable is useful ."	battery
p1436	 the cable length is n't displayed .	battery
p1437	 the only thing i do n't like is the short cable .	battery
p1438	" what i like is the charging speed and capacity , as well as the 8 pin iphone cable plug which compatible with the original iphone cable ."	battery
p1439	" ) hook up phone and use windows installer to install usb driver ( included in package from seller ) for the cable , 4 ."	battery
p1440	 i bought this cable/software to transfer pictures from my c417 .	battery
p1441	" finally , to boot , this was not at all expensive as most cable type charging units tend to be !"	battery
p1442	" i needed a new cable to charge phones that matched this cable end , but i certainly did n't want to pay a lot of money ."	battery
p1443	 i have been using the cable often and for a long time and it continues to perform well .	battery
p1444	" now , with this cable , no problems whatsoever ."	battery
p1445	 buying just the data cable alone will not allow you to put ringtones and wallpaper on your phone .	battery
p1446	" a kit implies that it 's more then just a cable and that is just what you get , a cable ."	battery
p1447	 i paid almost 14 dollars for a cable that basically does nothing because the software is not included with the cable .	battery
p1448	 be aware that the hole for the headphones/out-put cable is too small .	battery
p1449	" this does n't effect the connection of the cable i have ( which is pretty skinny around the connector ) , however it would interfere with a larger cable end ."	battery
p1450	" also , the charging does not happen correctly since the cover hinders the cable ."	battery
p1451	" so , first , my cable did n't work , had to use a better hdmi cable ."	battery
p1452	 * the charging cable does n't make complete contact and therefore falls out .	battery
p1453	" occasionally the usb port does n't connect well to the phone , so you have to make sure it is really connected ."	battery
p1454	" this charger was good , but the cable it comes with is junk ."	battery
p1455	 so if you want an oem charger be careful that it comes with a high quality cable .	battery
p1456	 one of the cords stopped working after 3 months and the wall charger never worked at all !	battery
p1457	" the $ 30 verizon chargers seem to stop working after a month or two , and the cords are only 3 feet long making them very inconvenient ."	battery
p1458	" without anything breaking , this charger just stopped charging within about a week of purchasing ."	battery
p1459	 case worked for about 5 days and now it will not turn on without being plugged in .	battery
p1460	" but , for having it for less than 48hours and it started to rub off and peal ."	look
p1461	" however , it does chip and peal off after a couple weeks ."	look
p1462	 the color options are awesome and its very portable .	look
p1463	" this case is beautiful and vibrant in color , it has somewhat of a grip so it does n't slip out of your hands easily ."	look
p1464	" i 've always had plain solid colors , but when i saw this i thought it would look nice ."	look
p1465	 this case keeps my phone intact and protected at the same time ...	look
p1466	 fits the mobile perfectly well and protects the mobile from scratches on the back as well as front side .	look
p1467	 i would not even give it one freakin star ...	look
p1468	" i will give 4 star , i liked it arrived on time ."	look
p1469	 i only give it 2 stars because it seems to take twice as long to charge my phone with this cord .	look
p1470	" it was worth a try for $ 24 , but without it performing for longer than 5 days i give this 1 star ."	look
p1471	 i 'd give zero stars if that was possible .	look
p1472	 recieved alot of compliments btu soon started to wear off and look old .	look
p1473	" i have received many compliments when using this cover , but it fits loosely and comes off too easy ."	look
p1474	 i have received so many compliments about my new phone cover .	look
p1475	 i received many compliments on this phone case the only thing was that the wear and tear of the product was fast .	look
p1476	 i have just received the case and started using ...	look
p1477	 i have received a lot of compliments on the cover itself .	look
p1478	" i bought the iphone 5 case from this company , and i really liked it ."	look
p1479	" i liked this case at first , but got sick of it really quick ."	look
p1480	 was very disappointed because i really liked the case .	look
p1481	 my only complaint is that the colors are n't near as bright as they are in the picture .	look
p1482	" pretty , but not as bright and vivid as in the picture ."	look
p1483	 i love it how colorful and bright it is .	look
p1484	 of all the cases i bought i wore this one constantly..	look
p1485	 the image wore off of the case pretty quickly .	look
p1486	 i was disappointed on how quickly the printing wore off .	look
p1487	" the case does n't come off easily , which is a plus , but i was disappointed in the way it wore so fast ."	look
p1488	" the core item itself is relatively hard plastic , spray painted with the color and texture of choice ."	look
p1489	 it is a hard plastic that has been painted .	look
p1490	" the things i did n't like is that though the outside of the case was coated in a black the inside of the case was gray and not coated at all , when the phone is placed into the case you can definitely see the gray borders which makes the phone look cheap ."	look
p1491	" i do n't like that the edges of the phone are n't painted , just left silver ..."	look
p1492	" it 's not a fancy expensive case , so it 's a basic plastic mold with & # 34 ; painted & # 34 ; on decor ."	look
p1493	 and the scratches were actually removing the colors ( painted on ) that made the owl image in the first place ! ! !	look
p1494	 if placed on a car console its plastic tackiness grips so it does not slide or collect lint .	look
p1495	 i love everything that has to do with the beach and collect light houses .	look
p1496	" feels nice and not too heavy , not slippery nor collect any lint ."	look
p1497	 other than that it 's a pretty cool case .	look
p1498	" cool metal case , i wish i could have used it but bad reception"	look
p1499	 cool case and concept but kills reception so i had to take it off .	look
p1500	" cool casethis case is so cool , and the flower power is great ."	look
p1501	" the sleeve is pretty cool and avoids damage to the case , which is a plus ."	look
p1502	 we are living in a material world and gadgets are cool .	look
p1503	 cool light up & # 34 ; m & # 34 ; .	look
p1504	 it works and the cool blue light is neat and helps to show its on .	look
p1505	 the ease of installation had my phone looking cool in minutes .	look
p1506	" regardless , the case is cool but in terms of durability , i 'll have to find out ."	look
p1507	" the cover is pretty cool , the charger is the preferred car charger for the lucid , and it includes the other goodies ."	look
p1508	 cool looking and keeps me from turning it off from the batt .	look
p1509	" the gap is very , very little and you can barley notice it ."	look
p1510	" for the price , it is neat , but i really doubt i 'm going to keep it on my phone ."	look
p1511	 i 'm not super tech savvy but i would think the possibilities are nearly endless especially for the mobile warriors .	look
p1512	" it looks sharp , but it does n't fit too well in the area of the volume buttons , making it hard to turn down volume , especially since it really bulges out in the area ."	look
p1513	 i love this these are a way to keep your phone a litter bit cleaner everyone should really try these	look
p1514	 its rather flimsy and i do n't like attaching it to the lens .	look
p1515	 there really is n't enough stability to hold on the ear either .	look
p1516	" if you like to share what you see , then you will love this lil thing regardless of the hassle ."	look
p1517	 this pretty much renders glass useless as a communication device .	look
p1518	 i really like the way navigation works .	look
p1519	" i really like it ; it does not look cheap , it came less then a month , i 'm very satisfied ."	look
p1520	 like it but it causes the battery to get really hot and lock the phone .	look
p1521	 i 'm totally pleased with these clever little gems .	look
p1522	 the only thing really wrong with it was trying to get it off was extremely hard & literally hurt my fingers .	look
p1523	 i think i actually still have it stored somewhere .	look
p1524	" otherwise , although it may look like the charger is inserted , it 's not actually charging the phone ."	look
p1525	" yes , this is good and i like it ."	look
p1526	 it really does not take a long time so if you are in a hurry it goes pretty quickly .	look
p1527	" for the price , was n't worth sending back & is really for those few times away from home or do n't have outlet handy & the battery gets really low anyway ."	look
p1528	" because this was sort of an off-market kind of thing , it looks like it 's shady to buy however yoj were n't at risk that much ( costed around 5 bucks at the time ) ."	look

p1535	 we were unsure which ones we would actually like .	look
p1536	 it does n't extend much but enough that it is difficult `` swyping '' on the keyboard because the phone will spin .	look

p1577	 loved this cover but the corner broke off the first week i had it .	look
p1578	 i loved the look of it and the feel but it broke within a week and a half of puttin it on my phone	look

p1580	" my only concern is on the second day i had it , one of the corners chipped off ."	look
p1581	 it has a cool 3d effect but at the cost of the paint rubbing off .	look
p1582	 all around the edge the paint is coming off : - (	look
p1583	" bought this for my phone , was ok for a few days , and then the paint started coming off and the corners started cracking ."	look
p1584	" i 'm guessing it 's residue from the painting process , be it paint or whatever it was mounted on during the paint process ."	look
p1585	" but in less than a month the paint started chipping off then not too long after that it started cracking easily , and my boyfriend rarely dropped or dose anything that could dammage his phone ."	look
p1586	 the paint started coming off so all i had left was a case with silver chipped paint .	look
p1587	 i have had it for a month and so far the paint has n't chipped off .	look
p1588	 the paint has started to fade in a few spots but its still very deep and colorful and full of life left .	look

p1595	 i anticipated less of a product and was very surprised .	look
p1596	 when it arrived i was surprised to see that it had sort of a 3d effect .	look
p1597	" i received the item on time and it works , but it is not as described or pictured ."	look

p1614	 what you see on the picture it 's exactly what you get ! !	look
p1615	 the case comes exactly like what you see in the pictures .	look
p1616	" in fact , if i scratch it the ink ( or whatever ) is easily rubbed off ."	look
p1617	" it arrived in okay condition , but the pattern was already peeling off the sides where it connects together to go over the phone ."	look
p1618	 around the sides the paint is faded and rubbed off and i have n't even opened it .	look
p1619	 but my only gripes about it was that the one i received looks like it was used already by someone else and the bordering on the side of my touchscreen look rubbed off .	look
p1620	 the paint job is slap-dash and only on the outer side of the skin .	look
p1621	 after a few months the vellum started peeling off at places where it rubbed ...	look
p1622	 i just wish that the paint would have held up better .	look
p1623	 yet after only a week the decals and paint have already rubbed off .	look
p1624	" i had this cover for about 3 months , after about 4 days the paint had rubbed off to the front and sides ."	look
p1625	 but as time went by the paint on the cover would just fall off ! !	look
p1626	" the paint on the edges of the case is worn off , like when a woman 's manicure starts peeling at the tips ."	look
p1627	" i like the cover it does it 's job , but the color is peeling off of the sides already ."	look
p1628	 the paint and shape of the case is very sturdy .	look

p1636	" this item was a very cute phone cover , i loved it when i got it ."	look
p1637	 they are so sticky in fact that when i went to change one out i had a heck of a time trying to peel it off .	look
p1638	 it was beginning to peel just a few days after having arrived .	look
p1639	 the only thing i could see wrong with it is that after a few months the pattern started to peel off the cover and the snaps come lose every so often .	look
p1640	" i loved the case when i first received it but shortly after , the case started to peel off at first i did not know what it was until i looked on the back of the case and it was missing spots ."	look
p1641	 i had it for about a week when the covering started to peel off the back where i hold my phone .	look
p1642	 this case was really pretty when when i first took it out the pack but after just 3 days the leopard print began to peel off the case .	look
p1643	" after a few months , it started to fade and peel away ."	look
p1644	 only thing was the cover started to peel off in places as looked kind of weird .	look
p1645	" if you have this problem with your cover , simply peel it back , then plug it in ."	look
p1646	" also , some of the stripes on the front are starting to peel a little ."	look
p1647	" after a few seconds later , the edges of the protector peel off from the phone ."	look
p1648	 then within 5 days the case started to peel .	look
p1649	 it does not have any funky smell like other usual cases on amazon .	look
p1650	 i absolutely love this phone case ; it fits my evo perfectly and looks really cute and feels really good too .	look
p1651	 the material feels really good and i love it .	look
p1652	" its really cute , fits well & really protects your phone ."	look
p1653	" i 'm in usa , i ordered the cover for galaxy ii that i bought from usa , the cover did n't fit , and the speaker location is different from the phone ."	look
p1654	" so if you bought galaxy ii from usa , do n't buy cover from outside usa"	look
p1655	" ordered this case , it looked great , fit well , and had the belt clip with it ."	look
p1656	" i was very happy with how this case looked , and it came with an optional clip for the back , which was nice ."	look
p1657	" i am a case collector , but i 'm also a tomboy so this case is just so perfect ."	look
p1658	" i have always wanted a double deck case , and this one is perfect !"	look
p1659	 this fits the phone perfect and almost has a 3-dimensional design because the print sits on top of the item with the case being kind of frosted black plastic .	look
p1660	 love the caselove the screen protectorslove the tool to get the case offlove this case ( :	look
p1661	" this case was as strong and nice as a case you can get from the stores , but cuter and it is easier to get on and off even ."	look
p1662	 this is perfect and a great case ! ! !	look
p1663	 they are even more jealous when i tell them how much i paid for it !	look
p1664	 it 's the pink piece that makes this unfortunate .	look
p1665	 after about a day it two the pink bow fell off !	look
p1666	" i thought i was getting red as shown here , but i got pink ."	look
p1667	 my phone reception went from 5 dots to 1 dot and kept cutting out when my phone was inside the case .	look
p1668	" not only was this a bad knock-off , but it the side was pink , not as advertised ."	look
p1669	 if you want this your not getting anywhere near a pink or hot pink iphone back glass i got this and it came and was purple	look
p1670	 the pink is n't as light like how it shows its dark but its okay ! !	look
p1671	 this is a quick money making scheme from the chinese company .	look
p1672	" when i got this item , i was shocked to find it was hot pink ! ! ! ! !"	look
p1673	" when the phone case came , i saw that it was a bright hot pink ( sort of neon-pink ) ."	look
p1674	" if you like gaudy , this is for you ."	look
p1675	 but went from `` sweet lookin '' to `` cheap lookin '' way too fast for my liking ! ! !	look
p1676	 it is so pretty and vibrant in the picture .	look
p1677	 the picture is not an accurate representation of what you will be receiving !	look
p1678	 i have the white case and it is impossible to take pictures with a flash on the white i am assuming reflects the light and causes a big white picture .	look
p1679	 in the picture the case looks white with leopard print but it 's not .	look
p1680	 it looks layered which does n't come across in the pictures .	look
p1681	" in the description picture , the phone looks more white but when i received it , it 's grey but that 's not a huge issue for me ."	look
p1682	 buy now most of the paint is chipped off & it looks horrible .	look
p1683	" the only downfall about this product is that the paint chips easily , and if you dropped your phone , the marks easily appear all over the case ."	look
p1684	 i was very disappointed to wait so long to receive my case and then it chipped a few days after i put it on my phone .	look
p1685	 by this time i have been on holds and discussions for more that 45 minutes .	look
p1686	 we 'll see how this holds up over time .	look
p1687	 now that i have used it for sometime now i can say that it holds up to what i put it through so i would recommend it to my friends and the time it took to get was right on time and now i just put my headset on instead of having to hold the phone up to my ear so i can have more of the long conversations	look
p1688	" well , these guys ( or whoever made em ) managed to do it !"	look
p1689	 these work great and seem to be well made .	look
p1690	" but i guess this is true for any device you attach to your belt , and not just a palm ."	look
p1691	" now , if only those clever folks at palm could figure out a way for my palm v to alert me when i leave it behind at the restaurant !"	look
p1692	" i do love the colors and 3d affect of this case/cover , but i had a heck of a time getting it on , finally had to have my husband work with it to get it to snap all the way around ."	look
p1693	" i get a lot of compliments on it , and the colors make it a little easier to find the phone when it is buried in that bottomless pit of my bag"	look
p1694	" i love it , i got lots of compliments on it ."	look
p1695	 after a short while the paint began to rub off and the color fade .	look
p1696	 there also spots where the paint was pealing off .	look
p1697	" it has not broken , but it has visible peeling/chipping ."	look
p1698	 nice while it lasted but the paint wore off very quickly .	look
p1699	 then the pattern began peeling off and finally it cracked .	look
p1700	 the case is adorable but i just could not deal with it chipping away so i took it off .	look
p1701	 the colored sheath is already peeling off of the case .	look
p1702	" not only did it arrive faded , scratched up with pieces of the paint missing , and terribly flimsy , but it also does n't fit because it 's somehow warped ."	look
p1703	" when i first received the case there were scratches were the & # 34 ; paint & # 34 ; had come off , almost like it was rubbed off ."	look
p1704	 after a month or so i notice more of the & # 34 ; paint & # 34 ; is rubbing off .	look
p1705	" i love the way this cover looks , but the paint started chipping a few days after i installed it on my phone ."	look
p1706	" also , the paint has started peeling off the back cover ."	look
p1707	 by the second week the clear plastic started pealing off still it eventually all feel off really was disappointed about this product	look
p1708	" i enjoyed it for a while , and it was super cute , but then the crystals started falling off , the purple started peeling , and the corners broke off ."	look
p1709	 my new brushed aluminum battery cell phone charger for my blackberry arrived today !	look
p1710	" first , the screens come scratched ."	look
p1711	 the inside faces of them are poorly finished and have crud chipping off .	look
p1712	" also , not a big deal , but i wonder how long before the bright and colorful owl starts to come off ."	look
p1713	 purple is my favorite color and this case is perfect !	look
p1714	 i like hawaiian print purple will be my next color case .	look
p1715	" love the color , not the purple showed , a little brighter purple ."	look
p1716	" second , it fit the phone perfect with no issues ."	look
p1717	 i 've no issues at all with this charger .	look
p1718	 had issues with these not charging our 9300 curve blackberries .	look
p1719	 we 've had these for a few months now with no issues .	look
p1720	 i have been having issues with others and thought they burned up but i think it 's the actual port in which the plug is inserted .	look
p1721	 i suspect other issues are occuring when using this charger .	look
p1722	 the folks on the other side of my calls have no issues on hearing me .	look
p1723	 i own two of these headsets and have not experienced any of the issues that the other reviewers have commented on ( i have had them over 3 years ) .	look
p1724	 the only issues i have with the set is that the way it was sold just had them all together and lacked organization .	look
p1725	 and it was actually kind of cool - they turn into marble sized squishy soft balls that bounce and retain their shape for quite a while ( about a week now out of water ) .	look
p1726	" i have a feeling this will continue , other than that i really like it !"	look
p1727	 i like the art work and the fit is like a glove .	look
p1728	 oh it also includes a cute carry bag which my daughter was tickled silly over !	look
p1729	" i was very upset , since i still like the case , but the quality is really bad ."	look
p1730	 it 's really cool and it 's comfortable to go .	look
p1731	" all-in-all , i really like this charger & use it often while traveling & the price was right ! ! !"	look
p1732	 there are two other features that are new that i really like too .	look
p1733	" really , no kidding ! ! ! ! ! !"	look
p1734	 i have had this over a year now and the paint is starting to peel .	look
p1735	" the flowers and butterflies are the top , with the muted leaves below that , andsplashes of blue below that ."	look
p1736	 she liked it very much and said the flowers were very pretty .	look
p1737	 it is not pink and white or even tan .	look
p1738	 the g slate requires a model psta-d01wt .	look
p1739	" the differences are as follows : on the yellow packaging you see a pda , ipod , camera and two cell phones ."	look
p1740	 make sure yellow light is glowing robustly before you charge .	look
p1741	 i would like to see this case available in navy and brown as well as black .	look
p1742	 i thought this case was beautiful when i got it !	look
p1743	 i thought it was the most beautiful case on here !	look
p1744	 a beautiful flowery case with the protection i needed .	look
p1745	" it looks so beautiful , but does n't fit the lg slider phone at all ."	look
p1746	" beautiful case , but top cover pops off occasionaly , not sure why ."	look
p1747	 beautiful case and seems to be of good quality .	look
p1748	 the cover is beautiful and i am glad i made this purchase .	look
p1749	 it is very beautiful and a great protection for the phone .	look
p1750	" this cover is awesome , beautiful , and fits great ."	look
p1751	 i think my phone will be wearing this cover for awhile because it 's so beautiful ! !	look
p1752	 no more craning your neck and getting fatigued while on the phone ...	look
p1753	" i have to use a headset all of the time for both my cordless and cellular phones because i have permanent nerve damage in my neck and right shoulder from a car accident , that prevents me from holding a phone to my ear for more than a few seconds ."	look
p1754	 while i thoroughly appreciate the thought on her part - knowing that i was having tmj and neck aches - this product is not good for what i wanted it for .	look
p1755	" i do n't like holding my phone to my ear for extended periods and the headset gives me comfortable hands-free without getting a crook in my neck , never mind the electromagnetic radiation from the cell phone ."	look
p1756	" you know , people who literally have pains in their neck from clamping a phone between their head and shoulders ."	look
p1757	 mostly what i like about thisis that it 's attractive and horizontal .	look
p1758	" sturdy clip , did n't try to pop phone out when i needed to grab the phone quick ."	look
p1759	 you can clip it on to your waist to keep it out of your way yet access it easily as necessary .	look
p1760	 lost my phone just this way and because of this product .	look
p1761	" i 've found it the least cumbersome ( with one hand ) to grab the phone by the antennae to lift it up and turn it to face me , but i still need the phone to & quot ; slide & quot ; across the palm of my right hand to get to where my fingers can curl around and reach the button to flip open the phone ."	look
p1762	" without modifications , you can un/clip this phone quick and snappy with one hand ."	look
p1763	 it snaps on and off my motorola v60g phone very quickly and easily .	look
p1764	 that way i can easily snap the phone of the holster with one hand and grab the phone with the other .	look
p1765	 i thought my provider was going to supply me with a mobile charger but nope just the standard home a/c model .	look
p1766	 these charge my bt earpiece and phone faster than my indoor ac chargers .	look
p1767	" i was disappointed to find that this was not a charger but a charging stand , requiring your plug-in charger to operate it ."	look
p1768	 ) the portable charger ( ac or 12vdc ) does allow the phone to be used ( send and receive ) while charging .	look
p1769	" it takes some jockeying , but the plastic tensioners move toward the phone charger slot to make room for the spare battery , which is inserted contacts down and facing toward the power supply connector ."	look
p1770	" ( i just needed an adapter between round legs and an american socket i bought for $ 2 in radio shack , no voltage converter needed ) ."	look
p1771	" 6 , it 's small , light wait and runs on both batteries and a ac adapter ."	look
p1772	 i wish that nokia would just supply that part ...	look
p1773	" the speakerphone can be run off the phone 's power , but it will drain the batteries quicker ; recommend using a power supply input when using it ."	look
p1774	 the transformer ( converts the ac to dc ) is relatively small and it has a long cord for utility .	look
p1775	" option # 1 go dig up the ac adapter from a drawer somewhere , and then find an open outlet to plug it into ."	look
p1776	" also , keep in mind that the stand does not come with its own power supply ."	look
p1777	" usually you feel the full weight of an iron-core transformer , but this feels like just an empty plastic housing ."	look
p1778	" while it is called a *charger* , it does n't come with the ac adaptor needed to actually supply power to the cradle ."	look
p1779	 the only downside is that you have to purchase the power source separately - in other words - that ac adaptor unit thingie .	look
p1780	" this ear piece for the nokia is an awful product , it very lowquilty ."	look
p1781	 for some reason the makers of this item thought it would be wise to make each size ear piece fit a different bluetooth .	look
p1782	 now to go look for cotton to stuff in the ear piece .	look
p1783	" this is a great cover , colorful and pretty ."	case
p1784	 the front cover actually wraps around the home button and covers the top black part with cut-outs for the speaker and camera .	case
p1785	" i also notice that this product do fit the sgs2 , but the cut outs was not good ."	case
p1786	" it is good , but does n't look like it is in the picture ; not as shiny , bright , and attractive ."	case
p1787	" nice i really like , fits well and easy to put on and remove when i need to exchange battery , only issue was the color ( blue ) is n't as bright as the picture showson the page ."	case
p1788	 the light blue swirls do n't look exactly like they do in the picture either .	case
p1789	 it fits correctly and has a glossy white look .	case

p1791	" not only are these things super cute , but they stay on forever ! !"	case
p1792	 it 's cheap and the buttons are super cute !	case
p1793	 received the button stickers super quick & they are super cute !	case
p1794	" my husband had super glue , so he glued back and it looks fine ."	case
p1795	 the pink was super cute and made my phone stand out alot more	case
p1796	" although cute , it comes off the phone very easily ! !"	case
p1797	 the phone gets super hot which indicates that there 's more current coming through than it should .	case
p1798	 i & # 34 ; m a cat lover so to open this package when received was super exciting .	case
p1799	 it 's too bad because it is really super cute .	case
p1800	" it 's sleek , stylish , makes me super happy !"	case
p1801	" i accidently bought this thinking it was for my iphone 5c and although it fits just barely , it looks super cute !"	case
p1802	 the charger is tough and durable .	case
p1803	 feels strong and according to me its a little bit shiny not solid black..	case
p1804	 the texture is comfortable while seeming durable .	case
p1805	" i have had it for less than a month , and the front cover has already broken ."	case
p1806	 the neck strap places the phone in a handy position .	case
p1807	 the color is nice and beautiful .	case
p1808	 plus the color is very beautiful .	case
p1809	 i do n't like the added bulk over my beautiful top of the line phone .	case
p1810	 i feel it will protect my phone as well as make it look beautiful .	case
p1811	 a lot more beautiful than the pic on site .	case
p1812	" for its price , it 's not too bad , with a beautiful design ."	case
p1813	 it really is a beautiful work of art and i am so grateful to have it !	case
p1814	 i had to turn it upside down for it to snap on all the way .	case
p1815	 the snapon wont snap on to the cell phone properly .	case
p1816	 they are kind of layered up colors and just look really cool .	case
p1817	 its not very easy to remove since the plug is so short and snug .	case
p1818	 when this charger goes it tends to loose it 's fit firmly in usb and has a short .	case
p1819	 then second the connection tip seemed to fit really tight then i guess after using it a while it loosened up .	case
p1820	" it 's a very tight fit all around , except the charger/the micro usb hole ."	case
p1821	" unlike other reviewers , mine did not fit snugly or tight ."	case
p1822	 these are awesome and make my phone look so stylish !	case
p1823	" great case , powers me up and very stylish ."	case
p1824	 it 's a perfect fit and is very stylish .	case
p1825	 the product itself fits very snugly on my i9100 and also gives it a stylish look .	case
p1826	 it is stylish and well fitting for the phone .	case
p1827	" this is not brain science , nor is it rocket surgery ."	case
p1828	 it 's 2011 ; it 's not rocket science !	case
p1829	" they are screwdrivers , so not rocket science here ."	case
p1830	 i love that this print is not the typical zebra print .	case
p1831	 this is the prettiest cover i 've ever seen !	case
p1832	" believe me , this little piece of metal brings some sanity ( and fun ) to all of this ."	case
p1833	 it is fun to see a luke-type pov and play as him .	case
p1834	 cover would not properly snap on to phone and the leopard spots have already worn off .	case
p1835	 it snaps on tight and protects the phone quite well .	case
p1836	 the metal strap of the battery has two screws that have to be removed .	case
p1837	" underneath the upperscrew is a grounding strap , which is very small and falls off the metal strap ."	case
p1838	" so , remove the metal plate verycarefully and observe the strap 's orientation ."	case
p1839	 the snap just broke off the strap piece .	case
p1840	 it was some cheap very thin metal ( aluminum foil-like ) used to secure the snap piece to the strap .	case
p1841	" for one , it has this silly strap on the back ."	case
p1842	 the only negative thing ( a small thing ) is that it does not have a carrying strap .	case
p1843	 the show is even longer when you type something like ' !	case
p1844	 ( even the pictures show them as all leather ) .	case
p1845	 this one is great - great look and does the job well - protection .	case
p1846	" hopefully they will improve the material used in the clip because , that aside , it 's a great handsfree unit ..."	case
p1847	 i drop my phone often and it has not broken at all .	screen
p1848	 i have had it on my phone for a while and it fits well and has n't fallen off .	screen
p1849	 i actually envy the guy that got 30 charges out of it .	screen
p1850	 acts as phone protector and charging case in one .	screen
p1851	" each time it was sent to me , the protector was more than an inch bigger than the phone it was supposed to be for ."	screen
p1852	 that would make it easier to separate the backing from the second half of the protector .	screen
p1853	 also came with the film to clean the screen and the bag it came in keeps my phone safe while in my purse .	screen
p1854	 then a message came on my screen saying that this device is not appleapproved and may not work .	screen
p1855	 it also came with a cute little anti-dust plug that looks like a lime .	screen
p1856	 maybe i 'm just an idiot and ca n't apply this protector correctly ...	screen
p1857	 instructions were clear and the protector is very forgiving of mistakes ( allows you to reapply ) .	screen
p1858	" i went through a gamut of cheap , poorly-constructed headsets until i found this one ."	screen
p1859	" it does charge , but my phone freezes and does not when it 's plugged in ."	screen
p1860	" when you plug it in , it freezes the keyboard so you ca n't use the phone , and it simply does not charge the phone , at all ."	screen
p1861	 while it is plugged in if i get a call it freezes up the phone .	screen
p1862	" second , there are very faint , but still there , film bubbles around the entirety of the case ."	screen
p1863	 i had to shave some plastic to get it on .	screen
p1864	 it started coming off on its own then i ran my nails over it and it just easily came off .	screen
p1865	" for the money sure this is good enough but i paid much more for the invisible shield which looks great , does n't scratch or curl ..."	screen
p1866	" now to their credit they have a nice grid to follow and the actual protector was ok , but not what i expected ."	screen
p1867	" but this product , once i apply , has been for 2 month , i have n't change yet and still clean and working good ."	screen
p1868	 they include a little squegee card to scrape the bubble out with as you apply it .	screen
p1869	" when the stick on gets scratch and hazy after a few montha , peel it off and apply a new one ."	screen
p1870	" as received , they do have an oily film over them ( perhaps to prevent corrosion during storage ?"	screen
p1871	" i only think it was okay because the cover , it had scratches ."	screen
p1872	 she has drop the phone and the cover protected the phone well .	screen
p1873	" problem is , it scratches your phone like crazy after around 4 months ( makes you want to keep the cover on !"	screen
p1874	 i bought a phone case 1 year ago and felt that it protected my phone from scratches and bumps .	screen
p1875	" it protected so will , i was unable to chance the gps settings , etc ."	screen
p1876	" product was advertised as & # 34 ; new & # 34 ; - it clearly was not , as all pieces can in zip lock bags , the protective plastic film was not on the phone , & the entire unit had many small scratches all over it ."	screen
p1877	 the case is good to protect the level from scratches and dust .	screen
p1878	 when charging with this device it does n't allow use of the mifi at the same time .	screen
p1879	" anyway , the discoloration is similar to what you get when you heat metal and allow it to cool ( think of some of your pots ) ."	screen
p1880	 i once again had to carefully use the razor blade to remove the screws .	screen
p1881	 let it dry out in tub of rice for a day .	screen
p1882	 everytime i try to watch a movie all it shows is a buffering or something .	screen
p1883	 i can watch my movies without the cord .	screen
p1884	 my phone stopped charging with a message & # 34 ; unable to charge & # 34 ; .	screen
p1885	 `` that is what i get for an error message .	screen
p1886	 when leaving others messages the message is typically inaudible .	screen
p1887	" luckily , these tools were never designed for heavy lifting ."	screen
p1888	 though the plastic spatula little brittle and broke when i was lifting my old battery .	screen
p1889	 i 'm still using mine even after i washed it !	screen
p1890	 i carefully pried the logo off and the two small holes it leaves are an improvement over the original look .	screen
p1891	" however this flip accessory only serves as a protector for the keys , it has no other fucntion ."	screen
p1892	" important : if your phone does n't turn on when you put it back together , do n't panic ( like i did haha ) ."	screen
p1893	" kit was very helpful , and all the tools made it easy to take apart and put back together ."	screen
p1894	 it includes everything you need to take apart and put back together your phones .	screen
p1895	 the leather fits tightly at first but stretches a little when it 's used .	screen
p1896	 the plastic used for this is not strong enough to take the stress .	screen
p1897	" the piece of plastic is excellent craftmanship , and mine did come with a keypad ."	screen
p1898	 i can not ding them for this but it would have been very nice if this set came in any type of protective plastic box or holders .	screen
p1899	 it protects much better than the cheapy plastic flip cover that came with the device .	screen
p1900	" to be truthful i never wanted to buy a case for my palm m100 in the first place , but the hinges on the plastic flip cover that came with it broke apart after only 3 months ."	screen
p1901	 the clear plastic is sometimes too reflective .	screen
p1902	" it would be nice if the plastic cover was a flip cover , but i can take it off the front , and put it on the back of the platinum ."	screen
p1903	" this case is not for a flip phone , as it has no way of accomodating the flip cover ."	screen
p1904	" when i purchased this case , i was under the impression that the plastic did not cover the buttons ."	screen
p1905	 as long as the battery is facing my body it works fine .	screen
p1906	" when i wear this on my waist , the antenna pokes me in the side frequency , and eventually the antenna broke off , although the phone seemed to work just fine without it ."	screen
p1907	 the design of the case causes the face of the phone facing out away from the body ( with the antenna up .	screen
p1908	" since there is no display on the case to see the display on the phone , a better design would have been to have the front of the phone face the person rather than away ( antenna on the bottom ."	screen
p1909	" the flip side in redesigning the case with the phone face facing your body is that the antennae would be on the bottom , causing more of the phone to be exposed and the case having less grip on the phone ."	screen
p1910	" but it did the job well , i was taking my blackberry tour apart ."	screen
p1911	 this was an extremely big help in taking my droid 4 apart .	screen
p1912	 purchased this kit to replace the usb port on my droid incredible 2 .	screen
p1913	 bought these for when i did my eb40 battery swap on my atrix hd .	screen
p1914	 and i will keep them i bought them to just change lcd in droid x and planed on tossing them after job done .	screen
p1915	 i used t5 & t7 to open up the back of a motorola xoom without any problems .	screen
p1916	" the jabra by the way , is collecting dust ."	screen
p1917	 i got this after i destroyed my charger with a vacuum cleaner .	screen
p1918	 on another note it attracts dust because it has the silicon feel .	screen
p1919	 what arrived was knock off crap that smelt like petrol and was slightly greasy/slippery to the touch .	screen
p1920	 it is not that easy to clean the accumulated dust off the blue fabric .	screen
p1921	" well , they degrade visibility somewhat-but they reduce glare ..."	screen
p1922	 what i dislike about this case is that little specks of dust and debris can work themselves between the case and the phone .	screen
p1923	" the holster leaves your phone face-out , so there is some chance of scratching the face if you 're not careful , but i 'm not too worried about that ."	screen
p1924	" after scratching the face of my palm , i decided to use a clear overlay protector ."	screen
p1925	 i stumbled across these while trying to buy more write right ( by fellowes ) protectors .	screen
p1926	 i contacted fellowes the maker and they are switching back to the static clip .	screen
p1927	 prob better for an ipod nice item though and shipping was quick .	price
p1928	 we 've bought several covers for ipods and phones through amazon and always get quick delivery .	price
p1929	" but overall , shipped quick and protected my phone for a little while ."	price
p1930	" not worth the money , no matter how cheap ."	price
p1931	" well , this item was super cheap so maybe i got my monies ' worth ."	price
p1932	" well , it was worth the money , i really loving it ."	price
p1933	" worth the money and a good buy , went well with my phone ."	price
p1934	 : ) ) ) ; ) : ) ; ) keep up with the comb s well worth it ! !	price
p1935	" for the cost you could do worse , and this product is well worth it ."	price
p1936	" excellent product , works great , have easy handling , and good quality as it is announced ."	price
p1937	" not worth hassle of returning , but i do not recommend ."	price
p1938	 it was so inexpensive tut i do n't care too much but i was n't too happy about it !	price
p1939	 it does exactly what i need it to do .	price
p1940	" though it does n't exactly meet the fast charging needs of high end phones , it works pretty well on all of them , you just need to be patient ."	price
p1941	 low cost for exactly what it needs to do .	price
p1942	 i 'll order them again if i need them .	price
p1943	 i needed to purchase this car charger on line because they are hard to find .	price
p1944	" for the cost , it is hard to find a better car charger ."	price
p1945	 hard to find a better value for a case for this phone .	price
p1946	 i think that it 's ok since she has not complained .	price
p1947	 this case fits perfectly on the s4 and keeps me powerd all day i ca n't complain !	price
p1948	" i ca n't complain about it since it works fine , and it just sits next to my desk all of the time anyway ."	price
p1949	" this is one of the best mic 's that i have bought , and i have bought a lot ."	price
p1950	" there 's a better , similar-looking device from scosche that i bought when these failed ."	price
p1951	 this is a better adapter then the many i have purchased from verizon .	price
p1952	 i wish they would have warned me before i bought it .	price
p1953	" the case was inexpensive , that 's why i bought it ."	price
p1954	 this software can be purchased on the internet .	price
p1955	" the shipping was super fast , the case came in three days ."	price
p1956	 great case fit my samsung galaxy s2 great will order again fast shipping it make my phone look super sexy trust me you need to order 1 .	price
p1957	 shipping was super fast and very pleased with the purchase ! ! !	price
p1958	" it is a great cover , value for money ."	price
p1959	 excellent value for the money and it arrived fast too .	price
p1960	 this is another great product that has helped keep my phone charged in my truckthis was a great product and deserves 100 percent .	price
p1961	 so this product was just an ok for me .	price
p1962	" good product , it does what it need to do ."	price
p1963	 other than this being my personal issue its a good product .	price
p1964	 this product was great and there was no problem with it .	price
p1965	 the case i got did n't come with an opener or flag pin though .	price
p1966	" i bought this for my wife , it 's much cheaper than getting one from a cell phone store ."	price
p1967	" great product , essentially the same thing you 'd get at the retail cell phone store ..."	price
p1968	" this is the same product you will find at all the major cell phone stores , the only difference is that it is 1/3 of the cost ."	price
p1969	 works really well	price
p1970	 i am not sure if this is the right one	price
p1971	" great quality , works perfectly ."	price
p1972	 i was skeptical at first to order as there are numerous false listing of `` oem '' products ... .	price
p1973	" the chargers were very reasonable , delivered in good time , and worked well ."	price
p1974	 works great great buy will be back to purchase other items in the future .	price
p1975	 very inexpensive so able to buy a few cases for backup ...	price
p1976	" this was a good buy for her , practical and inexpensive too ."	price
p1977	 if you want to buy this item go ahead and buy it ! !	price
p1978	" this was such a nice small and cheap item , i had to order 2 of them , just to have one in each car ."	price
p1979	 i found this on amazon right after i paid $ 20 .	price
p1980	" this item was the wrong size , but what i paid for it was n't worth the return ."	price
p1981	" i have yet to find other functions for it , but what a bargain ."	price
p1982	 oem as stated and worth with i paid for it .	price
p1983	" this is so cute for the money , you ca n't beat it ."	price
p1984	 ca n't beat getting what you ordered and some free stuff with it ! !	price
p1985	 but it turned out to be a great basic charger ( that did n't cost more than the phone ) .	price
p1986	" while the charger worked great , the headset itself took a crap after 2 weeks ."	price
p1987	 the charger works great and does what it is suppose to .	price
p1988	 this charger is less than $ 6 bucks and it works great .	price
p1989	" overall , i am extremely happy with the purchase , especially for so cheap ."	price
p1990	" if you buy this for a penny , plan on spending more to repair the damage it 'll do !"	price
p1991	 definitely worth the small amount i spent on it .	price
p1992	 was n't worth my time to mail it back .	price
p1993	 33 for this and it is worth nothing to me now .	price
p1994	 love the feel and look of the case but not worth the aggravation ! !	price
p1995	 not worth the hassle of waiting in line at the post office .	price
p1996	" no , it may not be worth more than $ 5 , but it sure is worth the 38 cents i spent on it ."	price
p1997	" i bought this skeptical as the other reviews above me were all negative , it is my second purchase of the same item ( bought elsewhere ) because i blew that one up by using to high of power plug , and i found it here cheaper ."	price
p1998	 when i was going to purchase this i was a little skeptical because it was so cheap and there were so little reviews .	price
p1999	" i was initially a little bit worried about cracking open my iphone , but decided to take the plunge ."	price
p2000	 but come to find out it was well worth the $ 2 .	price
p2001	" for someone who loses bluetooth earpieces often , this is an affordable find ."	price
p2002	" well worth the cost , garmin made sure there are no other cables that can be used for this purpose ."	price
p2003	" this one was not worth the money , as it lasted for such a short time ."	price
p2004	 it 's not worth returning because of the cost of shipping .	price
p2005	 `` though it does cost more than some of the other car charger 's for this model i believe it is worth it .	price
p2006	" now its hardly worth the hassle of returning them , because they were so cheap ; this is how i expect the company makes their money ."	price
p2007	 you just ca n't without paying the cost of a picture text message .	price
p2008	 it was a great value considering how much they cost in stores .	price
p2009	" for the cost , it just was n't worth it so i tossed it ."	price
p2010	 it did n't cost much and it does the job .	price
p2011	 purchased this and it 's good quality and worth the money .	price
p2012	" however , if you are going to spend time with this , the plantronics m175 by far worth the additional expense ."	price
p2013	 it might be worth it to pay the extra $ 50 and just have apple do the work .	price
p2014	 the cost is good .	price
p2015	 as well as the fact this style of stylus is far more efficient & much longer lasting than the 2 thicker popular models that sell between $ 6- $ 20 retail and online .	price
p2016	 it works well and stores wells in my car 's small compartment .	price
p2017	 a steal compared to the $ 30 they wanted at the t-mobile store .	price
p2018	" i could have purchased 10 of these for what some of them cost in stores , so it really is n't a big deal ."	price
p2019	" i suugest everyone to buy this headphones because of the following reasons , its 2 cheap to afford , its 2 light to carry , its 2 fancy to wear ."	price
p2020	 none of the headphones worked as well as the 170 did .	price
p2021	 in my old job i used headphones a lot while driving on interstates and i have been through a lot of different headphones .	price
p2022	 hold your cell phone next to a pair of regular headphones or speakers while it is being used and you will know what i 'm talking about .	price
p2023	" and for $ 10 , you ca n't beat it ."	price
p2024	 purchasing this set actually reduced the number of accessories that i have to carry .	price
p2025	 ) they seem to imply that otherwise i will be penalized by amazon .	price
p2026	 very thin and seems on the & # 34 ; flimsy & # 34 ; side .	price
p2027	 it seem kind flimsy and i am not sure on it reliability .	price
p2028	 learn from me & others stay away from this product .	price
p2029	 i 'll try to update this if it breaks or something .	price
p2030	" after using a different brand of car charger that would only work intermittently , i decided to get the brand for my phone ."	price
p2031	" this unit would be perfect except the wiring splits , peels , cracks and breaks internally ."	price
p2032	" so , what the heck , i figured i 'd try a battery kit ."	price
p2033	 i was very happy and pleased with the charger ! ! !	price
p2034	 happy happy happy happy glad glad glad glad glad will let someone else know about this product .	price
p2035	 i bought this and have been happy with it .	price
p2036	" very happy with it , works great , and very affordable !"	price
p2037	 what i liked : -- the cost was right ...	price
p2038	" the product is just good looking , though it is expensive comparing with others , it does n't have more advantages ."	price
p2039	 this is a really good product for the money .	price
p2040	 by looking at the product we can say it is veery very poor product .	price
p2041	 this product is my favorite purchase yet ! ! ! !	price
p2042	 i am very dissatisfied with this product and i feel that it was manufactured from inferior material as well as having poor craftsmanship .	price
p2043	 this product is well manufactured and a good variety of tools to use on any electronic product .	price
p2044	 this is a nice suprise considering some of the chinese communist crap that is so prevalent when ordering on-line .	price
p2045	" considering this the top of the line , i would have expected better from plantronics ."	price
p2046	 i echo the reviews that helped me choose this inexpensive set - the quality of the tools and the case are superb - great value and a solid tool that should last for a long time .	price
p2047	 very inexpensive and just wireless was great to deal with .	price
p2048	 it was a disappointment and i doubt i 'll buy anything that 's such a 'good deal ' like this again !	price
p2049	 this product is inexpensive and is a good deal .	price
p2050	 this was a deal that was too good to be true .	price
p2051	 but it turned out to be the best deal ever !	price
p2052	 it 's the best deal that i 've seen .	price
p2053	 00 best deal i ever had and it works better then the one i buy from other stores .	price
p2054	 a days tech has been excellant to deal with .	price
p2055	" in all , a good deal and i 'm ordering a second set this evening ."	price
p2056	" i am very pleased with the cost , speed of delivery , and the ease of the product ."	price
p2057	" anyway , whatever happened , delivery was so fast ."	price
p2058	" this place has been consistant in qualiaty , value and prompt delivery ."	price
p2059	 i think i got my money 's worth since it 's now time for a new phone anyway .	price
p2060	" since i only paid one cent for it , i bithed then forgot about it ."	price
p2061	 there is nothing special about this cable and nothing justifies the artificially inflated msrp listed for it .	price
p2062	" while this item is sold at a 90 % off the msrp discount , it 's probably okay to purchase one , for as long as , after reading the first paragraph you decide that you will need a usb 2 ."	price
p2063	" definitely , worth buying for a replacement or extra cord ."	price
p2064	 i bought this for my husband to go with his new blue tooth and it was definitely worth the money invested in it .	price
p2065	 this product is not work the 2 bucks i paid for it .	price
p2066	 i think i paid about $ 4 for it so maybe i got my money 's worth ?	price
p2067	 for what i paid it is a great purchase .	price
p2068	 some site were asking as much as 4 times what i paid here..	price
p2069	" 00 , and definitely got my money 's worth ."	price
p2070	" overall , i was surprised by the quality of this item for what i paid for it ."	price

p2111	 this charger works very well & is very inexpensive .	price
p2112	" this charger is not only inexpensive , but works perfectly ."	price
p2113	 i can not afford the risk of losing data by wearing the case outside my home .	price
p2114	 only reason i am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is that it takes quite a bit of adjusting and finesse to get the gel on the headset .	price

p2124	 ( even the pungent smell of the leather suggests quality .	price

p2127	 the is case is not even worth the low amazon .	price
p2128	" personally i do n't think it 's worth the $ 20 , and will see if the rhinoskin shocksuit fares any better ."	price
