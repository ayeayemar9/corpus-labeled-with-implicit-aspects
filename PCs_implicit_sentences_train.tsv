c1543	 i use mine with windows 98 me and it works great for me .	os
c1544	 the reason i know is because it tells me everytime i load xp .	os

c1553	 ( i need win 2k or win xp prof ) .	os
c1554	" it does n't work with xp , although it will install itself ."	os
c1555	 hp is not providing the needed drivers for vista or windows 7 .	os
c1556	" if your os can not accept incoming rdp sessions ( like xp and windows 2003 can ) , you ca n't use mira with it ."	os
c1557	" i used this drive in windows 98 , 98se , me , and xp operating systems without any issues ."	os
c1558	 xp has been the best operating system better than vista and windows 8 .	os

c1565	 i need a sql server destop installation but i cant do it with a xp home ( neither xp pro ) .	os
c1566	" when i got it , it had win2000 pro and 256m of ram ."	os
c1567	" and i can even use a free program from microsoft called rdc to login to the windows xp pcs on my home network , and display their desktops on the imac ."	os

c1574	" after using it for only a short while , i 'm a total convert ."	os
c1575	" irst of all , the speed and power of this system blew my mind ! although you cant directly compare pcs to macs , i can just tell you applications open in a snap with mac os x running at 933 mhz , when they would still be churning away with the hourglass on xp with 1 ."	os

c1582	 i have to say that so far i have been 110 % satisfied with this machine .	os
c1583	 i can say that i have pushed this machine to it 's limits .	os

c1585	" the positioning of the specialty keys ( home , pgup , ` , etc ."	interface

c1588	" i keep looking at the samsung q1 ultra , but it gets poor reviews ."	interface
c1589	 he previous reviewers were obviously victims of the poor and incomplete description given here .	interface

c1595	 this laptop has made me excited about the whole endeavor .	interface

c1614	" so if you are a hardcore gamer or 3d artist , this is not your choice ."	interface
c1615	 ne example is that xp now provides an nt-like performance/process management interface when you press ctrl-alt-del which to me is a huge improvement over win98 .	interface
c1616	 the ~ key is poorly placed ( i 'm a linux geek and the ~ key is important -- more of a personal gripe than anything else ) .	interface
c1617	 there is a light on the caps lock key and the built in hot key functions are nice as well .	interface
c1618	 the other thing that has annoyed me is some key placements the biggest of which is the lack of a ctrl key on the right side of the space bar which is something my old dell had .	interface
c1619	 i 'm considering trying to exchange it because of the stuck y key .	interface
c1620	 i also noticed the radiation symbol is upside down .	interface

c1642	 hooking up a jumper from the line out on the box itself to the line in on the computer does nothing because there is no signal on the lineout jack of the combotv box when you are plugged into usb .	interface
